Hi there! I'm Anmol. I am currently working as a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/). I graduated from International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad in 2023 with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering.

Currently, I am a part of the AI4Code group at MSR India. At IIIT Hyderabad, I was an undergraduate research student at [Precog](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/) IIIT-H, advised by [Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/PKguru/), where I worked primarily on problems in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. At the [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) at IIIT-H, I worked on infusing instance-level information in semantic maps for Visual-Language Robot Navigation tasks.

I believe the most impactful research questions are derived from real world problems. Hence, I wish to apply my engineering and research skills to tackle the world's most complex technology challenges.
